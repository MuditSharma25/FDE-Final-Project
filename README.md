Road Traffic Accident Prediction System (India)

This project focuses on predicting the severity of road accidents in India using machine learning. The objective is to analyze historical accident data and identify patterns that help determine whether an accident is likely to be severe or non-severe. The project follows a complete data engineering and machine learning pipeline including data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The dataset contains information related to weather conditions, road type, time of day, vehicle type, location, and other contributing factors.

The data preprocessing stage involves handling missing values, converting categorical columns into numerical form using one-hot encoding, identifying and treating outliers, and scaling numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure consistent input for model training. After preparing the data, it is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Various machine learning models were tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Logistic Regression performed best and was chosen as the final model, achieving around 85 percent accuracy depending on the train-test split.

Exploratory data analysis helped uncover important trends, such as higher accident occurrences during evening and night hours, increased severity in rural areas, and higher involvement of two-wheelers. Weather conditions like fog and rain were also found to have a strong relationship with severe accident outcomes. Different visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots were created to better understand the relationships among variables.

The project uses Python along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook. It represents a practical application of data science in road safety and public transportation analysis. In the future, this project can be improved by deploying the model through a web interface, integrating real-time traffic and weather data, and experimenting with advanced models like XGBoost or deep learning for improved prediction accuracy. This project was developed as part of the Fundamentals of Data Engineering course at RV University.
